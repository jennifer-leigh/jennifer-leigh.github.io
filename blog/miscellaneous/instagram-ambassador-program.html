                        Instagram is known for being a popular platform for influencers and ambassadors to find brand partnerships, but did you know Instagram has its own group of IG ambassadors? The programme, which aims to strengthen connections between the platform and influential members of its community, bring together young creators between 13 and 25 from a variety of community sectors – currently, the majority of ambassadors are artists, gamers and make-up artists, however the scheme is always expanding, so any Instagram creators are welcome to apply.

                    If you become an Instagram Ambassador, you join the programme for an initial 12-month period and then may be invited to participate for another 12 months. Danielle and Holly joined the programme in 2018 (when it was originally launched) and graduated in August 2020; myself (Jenny <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pastel.inspire/" target="_blank">@pastel.inspire</a>), Sophie and Lily joined in 2019 and are current IG Ambassadors.

                            I came across the Instagram ambassador scheme in 2018, I got a notification on my Instagram feed about applying to be a part of the program and a few days later I got an email saying I got accepted!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I came across the IG ambassador scheme when looking at other artists’ accounts and hearing them talk about it which really interested me so I decided to try and get involved.                        </p>

                            I applied through a notification on my feed and then received an email a month later stating I’d been accepted to the IGA programme. I was actually really suspicious at first(!) as to whether or not the programme was legitimate, but after some convincing I signed the relevant forms from Facebook and was invited to my first IGA group chat! We then had an introductory group call for all the new ambassadors.                        </p>

                            I received a notification at the top of my home page to apply which was sent to select accounts I think and from there it was like a regular application form. A few weeks later I got an email saying that I got in and signed a few extra permission forms and NDAs then was added to a group chat with other ambassadors as things started to begin!

                            As ambassadors we help Instagram out by taking part in surveys and video calls to give feedback about trends, new features etc. There’s also the occasional call/event with cool people from different areas of the Instagram company giving us insight into the industry and how they became successful which is definitely one of my favourite parts!

                        <p>
                            Tasks as an ambassador mostly consist of completing different questionnaires. These are based on a range of topics, all designed to better help Instagram understand the trends, and features that would appeal to their users. We also get early access and information on new features, this is so we can provide any advice and give our input on how they would better suit our needs. We then promote and share these new features and how to use them with our followers. For example, with the Create Don’t Hate collection of stickers, the ambassadors promoted them to do our part to put a stop to online bullying!

                        <p>
                            Yes we do – we are all in different DM groups with different ambassadors and the staff. They also are always there to talk to in DMs and on email.

                            There are various people who are involved with the IGA scheme, in the US, France, UK, Brazil and more countries! We also occasionally get to chat to members of other teams such as the Product Marketing team or the Safeguarding team through specialised focus groups, which is always an exciting insight into the inner workings of Instagram. There are Community Managers for each country who are active in our Ambassador group chats and are always keen to get involved in conversation, so we definitely feel like we’re working with Instagram when we contribute to discussions.

                        <p>
                            As ambassadors we sometimes get ‘swag’ which is essentially really cool Instagram merch! We get these at events and also occasionally through the post every once in a while and it really is super exciting when a parcel comes through. Items range from flasks, to bags, to notebooks and pens, so seeing what we get each time is such a surprise and it really is like Christmas!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another slightly less interesting perk of being an ambassador is the experience and how this can be placed nicely on a cv, to give something a little more unique to employers. And of course bragging rights with your friends and family!

                            Being an ambassador has meant that I’ve been lucky enough to have been flown to London for some amazing events held my Instagram where we’ve gotten to meet other ambassadors and attend panels and workshops! It was such an amazing experience to have been in a room with some of my art friends that I’ve met on Instagram that I’d known for years but would otherwise never have been able to meet in person!                        </p>

                            One memorable experience I had was being given backstage tickets to Summer in the City in 2019. I got to meet other ambassadors and speak to the leaders, see some of my favourite content creators and learn lots of useful info from the panels, especially the art related ones. It was amazing!                        </p>

                            My favourite part is being able to help improve features and being given access to new ones. I think it really shows that Instagram want to improve their app based on what their audience would like, and I really enjoy being able to have an input.

                            Without a doubt the best part of being an IG Ambassador is the people. Being in such a vibrant, positive environment with like-minded creatives, all buzzing with excitement about the paths that our hobbies may take us down, is irreplaceable. The other ambassadors have provided support, reassurance and a place where I feel accepted and loved. And I have made friends through this scheme who I hope I will keep with me forever, no matter where life ends up taking us!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also love the general fun and happiness that encases this scheme. From quizzes, and sharing pictures of our pets, to a weekly ambassador radio, it’s like living the best day of your life everyday, and I’m so grateful that the IGA scheme is a part of my life!

                            I would say that Instagram has affected my artistic career in a really positive way. Since making my art account I’ve had so many opportunities with my art, from working with companies, meeting many amazing artists, becoming an Instagram ambassador, gaining a platform for my art and being able to sell my artwork.
